# Elory - The Elephant Memory File Manager
A project to add custom tags to files on your desktop PC. Intended as a convenient way to keep track of like files,
without having to resort manually sorting files into folders. Built using Kivy
as the GUI framework, and sqlite to manage data. Everything else is native Python.
